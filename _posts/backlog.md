## Introduction

The health of your data depends on how well you profile it. Data quality assessments have revealed that only about 3% of data meets quality standards. That means poorly managed data costs companies millions of dollars in wasted time, money, and untapped potential.

Bad data [can cost businesses 30% or more of their revenue](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-au/growth-strategies/why-bad-data-could-cost-entrepreneurs-millions/332238). For many companies that means millions of dollars wasted, strategies that must be recalculated, and tarnished reputations. So how do data quality problems arise?

In the realm of data engineering, I have utilized various data profiling techniques, each of which sometimes results in us wasting time. Therefore, I have developed a data profiling automation procedure.
