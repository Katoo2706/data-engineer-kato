## Introduction
> Tech usages: Python, Flask, Polars

In the world of `Data Engineering` and `Business Intelligence`, we encounter numerous instances of data issues on a daily basis. Unfortunately, we often lack an efficient solution to manage pipeline failures without manually sifting through emails or checking dashboards. Additionally, there are cases where business users desire access to key metrics through their preferred communication channels.

To address these challenges, I've developed a data-driven Slack bot. This bot serves as a proactive `notifier` for `data issues` and `interruptions`, providing timely alerts for the Engineering team. Moreover, it seamlessly handles slash commands from business users, enabling them to retrieve essential `key metrics` directly through their preferred chatting channel.
